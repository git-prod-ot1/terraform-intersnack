This one is an example of encoded event where first record is significantly different from the second. It was discovered during beetloaders testing and it covers a case where one of the records has a specific data for partitioning whereas the other one misses it. In this case it's factoryid. It might be that the MQTT topic supports more than a dedicated flow and extra field may appear.
